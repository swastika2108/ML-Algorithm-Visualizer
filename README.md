# Machine Learning Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview
The **Machine Learning Algorithm Visualizer** is a web-based tool designed to help users visualize machine learning models and interact with datasets in real-time. This application simplifies the understanding of complex ML algorithms by providing graphical representations and integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to offer real-time explanations. The intuitive interface allows users to explore machine learning models and datasets, enhancing their learning experience.

## Objective
- Develop a sophisticated web application to visualize user-specific data and promote interactive learning of ML algorithms.
- Incorporate a chat-based explainer for better understanding and query resolution regarding algorithms.
- Integrate traditional ML algorithms and LLMs into a unified platform for holistic exploration and comprehension.

## Key Components

- **Data Visualization**: Automatically generates visual insights from user-uploaded datasets to assist in understanding patterns and data distribution.
- **Model Architecture Insight**: Displays the layers and connections within ML models for better understanding of decision-making processes.
- **LLM Integration**: Includes tools like Gemini for real-time ML concept explanations during visualization.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Users can explore algorithms and datasets through an intuitive interface.
- **Chat-based Explainer**: Integrated chatbot for real-time query resolution and algorithm clarification.

1. **User Uploads Data**: The user uploads a CSV file containing their dataset.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: The user selects an algorithm to apply to the dataset.
3. **Backend Processing**: The selected algorithm is applied to the data in the backend.
4. **Visualization**: The results are visualized in the web interface, providing a graphical representation of the model's behavior.
5. **Interactive Chat**: Users can ask questions and get real-time explanations via the chatbot integrated into the platform.

## Supported Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: A regression model to analyze linear relationships between variables.
- **Decision Tree**: A non-linear classification and regression algorithm.
- **Model-Based Visualization**: Graphical representation of model performance.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: An algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
- **Interactive Linear Regression**: A JavaScript-based interactive version of linear regression, allowing parameter adjustments in real time.

## How to Use
1. **Upload a CSV File**: Upload your dataset in CSV format.
2. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the algorithm you wish to apply.
3. **View Visualization**: Visualize the modelâ€™s results on the screen.
4. **Ask Questions**: Use the chat feature for real-time feedback and explanations.
